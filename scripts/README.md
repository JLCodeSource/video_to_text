# Scripts Directory

This directory is reserved for utility scripts to support development workflows, testing, or automation tasks.

Currently empty - scripts can be added here as needed.
- Author and assignees
- Created, updated, and closed timestamps
- All comments with author and timestamps
- Issue URL

### Notes

- Export files are gitignored by default (contain full issue history)
- The script can be re-run safely to generate fresh exports
- Rate limiting: Script respects GitHub API rate limits
- Large repositories: May take several minutes for repos with many issues
